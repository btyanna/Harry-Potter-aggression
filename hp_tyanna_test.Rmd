```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Loading packages and data
```{r, include = F}
library(tidyverse)
hpdata = read_csv("harry_potter_aggression_full.csv")
```

2. Basic wrangling and make a graph of Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy aggression rates
```{r, message = F, echo = F, fig.align = 'center'}
hpgraph = hpdata %>% 
  filter(Name == "Harry" | Name == "Draco Malfoy") %>% # | --> OR for wanted rows
  select(Name, book, agg.per.mention) %>% # selecting wanted colmns
  ggplot(aes(x = book, y = agg.per.mention)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Name), position = "dodge") + # position = "dodge" --> cluster colm 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_classic()

hpgraph
  
```
